   <h1>Hi My name is Brandon</h1>
   <p> I am a guy who likes to play video games, watch shows online and hang out with my friends. Despite being an introvert, I like to make new friends and connect with others more often. Life might be full of ups and downs but I like to keep a positive outlook on things. Being a Year 2 Industrial Design student, I hope to explore the different kinds of design and have fun with it. 
   </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Empathy in understanding users</li>
      <li>Business-Savvy in looking for viability/li>
      <li>Design Thinking in solving problems</li>
    </ul>
